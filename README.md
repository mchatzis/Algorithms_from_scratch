# Algorithms
This repository contains algorithms I implemented from scratch in order to advance my algorithmic proble solving and Python skills. 
Every line of code in this repository is mine, not even inspired from an other source. 
I understood the pseudocode of the algorithm and then implemented it from memory in Python.
