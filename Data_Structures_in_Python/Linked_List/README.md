## Python implementation of a linked list

Cool functionalities: 
- Using member function `to_linked_list`, any iterable can be converted to this custom linked list implementation
- List is printed like a common Python list due to the `__str__` method. Just use print(my_linked_list) as you would casually do for a common list.
