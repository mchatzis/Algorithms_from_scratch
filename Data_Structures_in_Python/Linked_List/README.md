## Python implementation of a linked list

Cool functionalities: 
- Using member function `to_linked_list`, any iterable can be converted to this custom linked list implementation
- The class is implementing the `Iterable` interface. Hence, you can just call `list(my_linked_list)` on your linked list and it will be converted to a normal list
- List is printed like a common Python list due to the `__str__` method. Just use print(my_linked_list) as you would casually do for a common list.
